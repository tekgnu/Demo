# Demo
This is just a repository for code-based Demonstrations that I have shared with customers.
See each demo for their inline documentation and below for additional details.

For each of the demos there is a reference to . ./AZ_Sub_Details_1.ps1 - this file contains the variable declarations for the Azure Tenant and associated Subscription.
Example:

*$TENANTID_DEF       = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*
*$SUBCRIPTIONID_DEF  = "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy*


## Keyvault_Demo
This is just an AZ Powershell script to deploy a service principal with a defined scope to a resource group, deploy a keyvault, and create / recall a key secret.
This demo includes a Jupyter notebook as well as the exported powershell script.

## VM Create_Demo
This is just a quick and dirty script to produce a vm or to be looped for a series of vms.
